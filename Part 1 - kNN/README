This folder contains my code for part 1 of the assignment, kNN.
To run my code, simply follow these steps:

- Navigate to the folder where the entire project is located using the command line
- From this location use the following commands (right click in the console to paste):
- cd 'COMP307 Assignment 1 Final/Part 1 - kNN/'
- python Part1.py Data/wine-training Data/wine-test

The code should run as expected and generate the output which is stored in sampleoutput.txt
Note that the code uses k=1, but the code can be changed on line 93 in Part1.py to use any k

Libraries used:
- math
- random
- numpy as np
- pandas as pd
- sys
To install these libraries if they are absent (shouldn't be needed) use the pip install command

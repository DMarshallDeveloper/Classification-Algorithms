This folder contains my code for part 3 of the assignment, the Perceptron.
To run my code, simply follow these steps:

- Navigate to the folder where the entire project is located using the command line
- Make the command line window full screen in order to see the perceptron results printed properly
- From this location use the following commands (right click in the console to paste):
- cd 'COMP307 Assignment 1 Final/Part 3 - Perceptron/Part3Perceptron/out/artifacts/unnamed/'
- java -jar Part3Perceptron.jar

The code should run as expected and a sample output has been stored in sampleoutput.txt
Note that the actual output which you will see will differ due to the random generation of the features
My code sometimes converges in as early as 20-30 epochs, and sometimes takes the full 100 epochs without converging,
it all depends on how good the random features are.

This folder contains my code for part 2 of the assignment, the Decision Tree.
To run my code, simply follow these steps:

- Navigate to the folder where the entire project is located using the command line
- Make the command line window full screen in order to see the decision tree printed properly
- From this location use the following commands(right click in the console to paste):
- cd 'COMP307 Assignment 1 Final/Part 2 - Decision Tree/Part2DecisionTree/out/artifacts/unnamed/'
- java -jar Part2DecisionTree.jar

The code should run as expected and generate the output which is stored in sampleoutput.txt
